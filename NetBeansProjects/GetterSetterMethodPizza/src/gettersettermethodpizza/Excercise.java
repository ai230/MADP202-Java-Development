    1  a. Create a class named Pizza. Data fields include a String for toppings (such as “pepperoni”),
    an integer for diameter in inches (such as 12), and a double for price (such as 13.99). 
    Include methods to get and set values for each of these fields. Save the class as Pizza.java.
   b. Create an application named TestPizza that instantiates one Pizza object and demonstrates 
    the use of the Pizza set and get methods. Save this application asTestPizza.java.

2 a.
Create a class named Circle with fields named radius, diameter, and area.
    Include a constructor that sets the radius to 1 and calculates the other two values. 
    Also include methods named setRadius() and getRadius().
    The setRadius() method not only sets the radius, it also calculates the other two values. 
    (The diameter of a circle is twice the radius, and the area of a circle is pi multiplied 
    by the square of the radius.) Save the class as Circle.java.
b. 
Create a class named TestCircle whose main() method declares several Circle objects.
    Using the setRadius() method, assign one Circle a small radius value,
    and assign another a larger radius value. Do not assign a value to the radius of the third circle; 
    instead, retain the value assigned at construction. Display all the values for all the Circle objects. 
    Save the application as TestCircle.java.
